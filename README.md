This notebook demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch for an image classification task. Specifically, it uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

Key Libraries Used
torch: The main PyTorch library for tensor operations and neural networks.
torchvision: Provides popular datasets, model architectures, and image transformations.
matplotlib.pyplot: For plotting and visualizing data (e.g., images, confusion matrices).
sklearn.metrics: For evaluating model performance, specifically the confusion matrix.
